# Dante Sarotti's Git
A place where I'm saving my programming exercises and sharing them with my partners from the day I started learning.

## Folder Structure

- `src`: the folder where sources are saved.
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies.
- `bin`: the folder where compiled output files will be found (for now, all .class files will be ignored).
- `Copiando al profesor`: the folder where im shamelessly copying everything the teacher does.
