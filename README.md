# Dante Sarotti's Git
A place where I'm saving my programming exercises and sharing them with my partners from the first day I started learning.

## Folder Structure

- `src`: the folder where sources are saved
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `bin`: the folder where compiled output files will be found
